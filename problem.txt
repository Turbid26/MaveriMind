 6. Web Application: Community Mental Health Support Platform
 Problem Statement: Create a web application designed to facilitate community-driven mental
 health support by connecting users with peers, therapists, and wellness resources. This
 platform should offer AI-powered mood tracking, access to mental health resources, and
 anonymous forums for users to seek support, all while using NLP to ensure user safety and
 detect distress signals.
 Challenges to Address:
 ● Natural Language Processing: Implement NLP models to detect negative sentiment or
 distress in user interactions.
 ● User Safety: Develop real-time alerts for crisis intervention while ensuring user
 anonymity and security.
 ● Personalization: Provide tailored resources and support based on individual needs and
 emotional states.
 ● Data Privacy Compliance: Ensure strict privacy measures to protect sensitive mental
 health data.
